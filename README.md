# ☁️ AtmosphEX (Project Abandoned)

☁️ AtmosphEX is a real-time rocket simulation built around a custom game engine, designed to provide a hands-on experience of rocket flight dynamics and basic physics. The project simulates a rocket launch from the ground to high altitudes, with a focus on realistic physics, particle effects, and real-time telemetry. Using OpenGL for rendering and ImGui for displaying stats, the simulation lets users control and monitor the rocket's performance while providing insights into the forces affecting its flight.
